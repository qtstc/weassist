	<p>The WeAssist app requires access to your location to function correctly. If you don't wish to allow access to your location, tap cancel and you will be signed out.</p>
	<p>We do not store your location data for basic WeAssist functions like browsing past and current WeAssist requests near you. When you send out an assistance request, your trusted contacts will have access to your current location. If you choose to additionally share the request publicly with those near you, the location of that specific request will be shared with all WeAssist users. When you use the WeFind service, your location data is stored on the server so your trusted contacts know where to find you if they think you might need some assistance.</p>
<p>We are committed to keeping your data secure at all times. You may reach the WeAssist Developer team for feedback or support at weassistapp@live.com</p>
