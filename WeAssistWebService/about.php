<h2>About the WeAssist</h2>
<p>WeAssist is a Windows Phone 8 application that aims at making it easier to seek assistance as well as providing help to others. With just a few taps on their Windows phone, a user can share a new request along with their location and a message. </p>
<p>Once the user has set up a list of trusted contacts, they can share new assistance requests with the entire list at once. The user’s trusted contacts will be notified via one or more of SMS, Email and Push channels depending on their preferences.</p>
<p>WeAssist also has an optional location tracking service, WeFind which runs in the background and securely uploads the user’s location history to the cloud at user-defined intervals. This feature comes in very handy in a situation when the user cannot be reached directly because of issues like the phone being out of power or cellular connectivity. In such a case, the trusted contact with WeFind access can use the last location in WeFind history to reach the user.</p>
<p>The WeAssist service does not just stop at facilitating the information exchange between family and friends, and it provides a platform for the people in the same community to help each other. When sending assistance requests, the user has the option of sharing it publicly with other WeAssist users who are nearby while at the same time having complete control over what data is shared publicly.</p>
